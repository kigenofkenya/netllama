##A lighter way to play music

A Netllama public Beta - Completely not ready but i'm getting heavy use out of it already so why not share.


Okay so there's a badly coded / not particularly well styled beta one - I'm releasing it because it actually somehow works despite huge flaws. It'll allow you to put in an exported playlist from itunes and it'll play those tracks in a browser window allowing you to skip / go back / pause and adjust volume - It doesn't care where those music files live - they could be on a server or an internet radio station - doesn't matter - Also you don't need to be online unless you want to play files that are online - it just works. 
It'll also tell you what track number and album and duration/ time remaining - No seek bar yet.


Right now it's very very rudimentary but i'm already getting pretty good use from it on my lowly 2gb macbook air that doesn't like itunes on in the background. There's no license but I don't care - share it/sell it/ remake it - it's FOSS.

Export from Itunes as m3u8 playlist file and it'll work.
